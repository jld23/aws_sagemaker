    "- Autopilot supports tabular data formatted as CSV or Parquet.\n",
    "- Columns should be a feature with a specific data type and each row should be an observation.\n",
    "- Accepted column data types include numerical, categorical, text, and time series that consists of strings of comma-separate numbers.\n",
    "- Supports building models on datasets up to hundreds of GBs.\n",
    "- Autopilot uses cross-validation to build models in hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and ensemble training mode for small datasets with 50,000 or fewer training instances. In ensemble mode, cross-validation is performed regardless of dataset size.\n",

    "- In HPO mode, you can see the training and validation metrics from each fold in your /aws/sagemaker/TrainingJobs CloudWatch Logs.\n",
    "- Cross-validation can increase training times by an average of 20%. Training times may also increase significantly for complex datasets.\n",

    "        - If 20 < ùëö ‚â§ 100: use k-fold cross validation with a relatively large ùëò‚â§ùëö keeping in mind computational cost.\n",
    "        - If 100 < ùëö ‚â§ 1,000,000: use regular k-fold cross validation (ùëò=5).\n",
    "        - If there is not enough computational power and ùëö > 10,000:  use hold-out cross validation.\n",
    "        - If ùëö ‚â• 1,000,000: use hold-out cross validation, but if computational power is available you can use k-fold cross validation (ùëò=5) if you want to squeeze that extra performance out of your model."
