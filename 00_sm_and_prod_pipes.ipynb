However, this series is designed to take advantage of the managed infrastructure and other benefits of using SageMaker Studio, so that will be the prefered environment for all posts in the series. I won't be testing, trying, or troubleshooting the code to work on stand alone SageMaker Jupyter Notebook instances or local environments."
